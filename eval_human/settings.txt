      <b> Image: </b> <br>
      <img src="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rak248/VG_100K_2/2386780.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="300" height="220">
  </p>
  <p>
      <b> Description: </b> <br>
      a man with the black bike is standing in front of the house.<br>
      the man is wearing a brown jacket and a small cap.<br>
      the house behind the man is white with many windows.<br>
  </p>
    <p> <b> Why is it a good description? </b> </p>
    <p>This is a good image description because it describes image objects accurately with correct words.
    The description is focused mostly on the important details: a man with the black bike, man's clothes, some of the surroundings.
   The sentences are well-structured because each of them introduces some new piece of information and does it without errors.
  Overall, the text forms a good story, which flows well.</p>

Bad Examples:

<negative-example>
  <p>
      <b> Image: </b> <br>
      <img src="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rak248/VG_100K/2354861.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="300" height="220">
  </p>
  <p>
      <b> Description: </b> <br>
      a woman is on the skateboard in the air.<br>
      there are many trees and white cars around him.<br>
      some cars are white.<br>
      some trees are green.<br>
  </p>
    <p> <b> Why is it a bad description? </b> </p>
    <p> This is a bad image description because it is describing objects, which are not in the image ('woman' instead of 'boy',
      non-present 'trees'). It also focuses on unimportant parts of the image (cars, surrounding) without describing a boy in detail,
      which seems to be important. The sentences are not that well-structured, because some of them are redundant (multiple descriptions of cars).
      The story that the description tells is not that good,
    because it is pretty non-informative, very general and not detailed enough.</p>

Good descriptions:

      <b> Image: </b> <br>
      <img src="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rak248/VG_100K_2/2386780.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="300" height="220">

      <b> Description: </b> <br>
      a man with the black bike is standing in front of the house.<br>
      the man is wearing a brown jacket and a small cap.<br>
      the house behind the man is white with many windows.<br>
  </p>
    <p> <b> Why is it a good description? </b> </p>
    <p>This is a good image description because it describes objects and events in the image with correct words and the right detail.
    The description is focused on the relevant parts of the scene, what the image is about: a man with the black bike, man's clothes, some of the surroundings.
   The sentences are grammatical and well-structured. Each of them introduces some new piece of information in a natural order.
  Overall, the text forms a good narrative or story which flows well.</p>

Bad descriptions:

<negative-example>
  <p>
      <b> Image: </b> <br>
      <img src="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rak248/VG_100K/2354861.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="300" height="220">
  </p>
  <p>
      <b> Description: </b> <br>
      a woman is on the skateboard in the air.<br>
      there are many trees and white cars around him.<br>
      some cars are white.<br>
      some trees are green.<br>
  </p>
    <p> <b> Why is it a bad description? </b> </p>
    <p> This is a bad image description because it is referring to objects that are not in the scene ('woman' instead of 'boy',
      not-present 'trees'). It focuses on unimportant parts of the scene (cars, surroundings) without describing the important parts, e.g. the boy. The sentences have a good strcuture and are grammatical. However, they are not well-connected: some of them are redundant (multiple descriptions of cars) and therefore the story that the descriptions tells is very general and uninformative.</p>

        You are going to be shown an image and several sentences describing the image. <br>
        Below you will see statements that relate to the image descriptions. <br> <br>
        Please rate each of these statements by moving the slider along the scale where
        0% stands for ‘I do not agree’, 100% stands for ‘I fully agree’.

      <h3>Detailed Instructions</h3>
        <p>In general, you are required to judge image descriptions based on the following:</p>
          <ol>
              <li><b>choice of words</b>: does the text correctly describe objects and events in the scene and with the right detail?</li>
              <li><b>relevance</b>: does the text describe relevant objects and events in the scene?</li>
              <li><b>sentence structure</b>: do the sentences have a good and grammatical structure?</li>
              <li><b>coherence</b>: does the text progreess in a natural way forming a narrative?</li>
          </ol>
        <p>You can enter any feedback you have for us, for example if some questions were not easy to answer, in the corresponding feedback field (right after the survey).</p>
        <p> Please try to be as objective as possible.</p> <!--- SD: actually, we want them to be subjective -->

          <b> Image: </b> <br>
          <img src="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rak248/VG_100K_2/2386780.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="300" height="220">

          <b> Description: </b> <br>
          a man with the black bike is standing in front of the house.<br>
          the man is wearing a brown jacket and a small cap.<br>
          the house behind the man is white with many windows.<br>
      </p>
        <p> <b> Why is it a good description? </b> </p>
        <p>This is a good image description because it describes objects and events in the image with correct words and the right detail.
        The description is focused on the relevant parts of the scene, what the image is about: a man with the black bike, man's clothes, some of the surroundings.
       The sentences are grammatical and well-structured. Each of them introduces some new piece of information in a natural order.
      Overall, the text forms a good narrative or story which flows well.</p>

          <p>
              <b> Image: </b> <br>
              <img src="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rak248/VG_100K/2354861.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="300" height="220">

          <p>
              <b> Description: </b> <br>
              a woman is on the skateboard in the air.<br>
              there are many trees and white cars around him.<br>
              some cars are white.<br>
              some trees are green.<br>
          </p>
            <p> <b> Why is it a bad description? </b> </p>
            <p> This is a bad image description because it is referring to objects that are not in the scene ('woman' instead of 'boy',
              not-present 'trees'). It focuses on unimportant parts of the scene (cars, surroundings) without describing the important parts, e.g. the boy.
              The sentences have a good structure and are grammatical. However, they are not well-connected:
              some of them are redundant (multiple descriptions of cars) and therefore the story that the descriptions tells is very general and uninformative.</p>

      <p>Given an image and text that describes this image, answer the questions about the description.</p>
    </short-summary>

    <detailed-instructions>
      <h3>Detailed Instructions</h3>
        <p>In general, you are required to judge image description based on three questions:</p>
          <ol>
              <li><b>general understanding</b>: is it a clear description?</li>
              <li><b>structure</b>: does its structure make it easy to read?</li>
              <li><b>depth</b>: does it describe image in detail?</li>
          </ol>
        <p> After answering the questions, you can enter any additional feedback you have for us in the corresponding feedback field (right after the survey). If you think that it was hard to answer some of the questions, please use the feedback field to tell us your thoughts.</p>
        <p> Please try to be as objective as possible.</p>
        <p> Important: you must choose only ONE answer per section (there are three available answers per section). Be attentive and follow this rule carefully. </p>

          <b> Image: </b> <br>
          <img src="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rak248/VG_100K_2/2386780.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="300" height="220">
      </p>
      <p>
          <b> Description: </b> <br>
          a man with the black bike is standing in front of the house.<br>
          the man is wearing a brown jacket and a small cap.<br>
          the house behind the man is white with many windows.<br>
      </p>     
        <p> <b> Why is it a good description? </b> </p>
        <p> The description depicts a lot of salient details about objects (colour, position of objects). It also reads well, properly describing objects without unnecessary repetitions.
        It nicely covers most of the image objects and can be judged as a full and coherent description; its sentences logically follow each other.</p>

          <b> Description: </b> <br>
          a woman is on the skateboard in the air.<br>
          there are many trees and cars around him.<br>
          some cars are white.<br>
          some cars are green.<br>
      </p>     
        <p> <b> Why is it a bad description? </b> </p>
        <p> The description depicts only a number of objects. It can be more detailed (mention clothes, discriminate between cars) and should be more accurate (there are no trees around, it is a boy in the iamge). Also, its structure seems to be a bit unnatural (last two sentences differ by a single word only). Generally, the text is not detailed enough to describe the image properly (though it mentions some of the objects), its coherence is suffering.</p>

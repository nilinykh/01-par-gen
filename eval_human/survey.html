      <h3>Detailed Instructions</h3>
        <p>In general, you are required to judge image description based on the following:</p>
          <ol>
              <li><b>choice of words</b>: does the text accurately describe image objects?</li>
              <li><b>importance</b>: does the text describe important objects?</li>
              <li><b>structure</b>: does the text have a good sentence structure?</li>
              <li><b>coherence</b>: does the text form a good logical story?</li>
          </ol>
        <p> After answering the questions, you can enter any additional feedback you have for us in the corresponding feedback field (right after the survey). If you think that it was hard to answer some of the questions, please use the feedback field to tell us your thoughts.</p>

          <img src="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rak248/VG_100K_2/2386780.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="300" height="220">

          <b> Description: </b> <br>
          a man with the black bike is standing in front of the house.<br>
          the man is wearing a brown jacket and a small cap.<br>
          the house behind the man is white with many windows.<br>
      </p>
        <p> <b> Why is it a good description? </b> </p>
        <p>This is a good image description because it describes image objects accurately with correct words.
        The description is focused mostly on the important details: a man with the black bike, man's clothes, some of the surroundings.
       The sentences are well-structured because each of them introduces some new piece of information and does it without errors.
      Overall, the text forms a good story, which flows well.</p>

      <p>
          <b> Description: </b> <br>
          a woman is on the skateboard in the air.<br>
          there are many trees and white cars around him.<br>
          some cars are white.<br>
          some trees are green.<br>
      </p>
        <p> <b> Why is it a bad description? </b> </p>
        <p> This is a bad image description because it is describing objects, which are not in the image ('woman' instead of 'boy',
          non-present 'trees'). It also focuses on unimportant parts of the image (cars, surrounding) without describing a boy in detail,
          which seems to be important. The sentences are not that well-structured, because some of them are redundant (multiple descriptions of cars).
          The story that the description tells is not that good,
        because it is pretty non-informative, very general and not detailed enough.</p>

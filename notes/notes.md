  - Draft of the paper
  - Two models of information fusion:
	* Grounded object model: but the groudning is circular; denscap regions are used to predict the descriptions but then these descriptions are fused back with the dense-cap representations
	* Language as background knowledge model: dense-cap descriptions are used as a background knowledge support for the generation; the model can attend either on densecap regions (something visually interesting to describe) or on a chunked phrase coming from nackground knowledge
  - Evaluate grounded object model for language only, and language and attention
  - Setup human evaluation experiment: categores
	* Naturalness of description
	* Choice of words
	* Syntactic structure
	* Coherence of the text

Nikolai

  - Train some more models: model with background input, model with background input and attention
  - Expected: good generations, probably better than those generated with visual information only
  - Motivation for multimodal features: why do we construct them exactly the way it is done? Grounding motivation: learning linear layer to map two modalities together and ground language and vision into the same space with ReLU. Knowledge motivation: learn to choose between visual and background information, learn to decide which type of modality is more important for the current timestamp. Motivation for choosing strategy to build multimodal vector is crucial.
  - Human evaluation set-up: how natural the paragraph is? Evaluate across different properties: syntactic structure, choice of words, coherence, interestingness (already entailed by naturalness?), repetitiveness (we do not want repetitions)
  - Leave some feedback fields in human evaluation and ask humans to add any comments they would like to add.

  - Interpretation of the beam search and lenght of sentence: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09582.pdf
  - BLEU and CIDeR
	* our BLEU scores are lower than Krause (30 vs 41 for BLEU1) but our CIDeR scores are higher (18 vs 13.5)
	* we are catching less wods, n-grams than the original implementation compared to ground truth
	* those that we do ctach are more unique and identifying for this image; goes with the principles of GRE
  - METEOR
    * Krause: 15.9; ours 12.8; works on synonyms
	* how many content words (vs functional words) did we get; normalised by the length of the prediction and penalised by the fact whether we predict them as single chunks or distributively
  - CIDeR
    * TF/IDF of each generated word
	* create a vector for n...4 grams
	* words not present are 0
	* take cosine similarity between the generated vectors and ground truth vectors
  - Actual generations
	* attention focuses on describing (only) objects in the focus of attention, e.g. the bus
	* backrgound knowledge adds spatial descriptions and relations between objects, information coming from densecaps; tge focus is to mention all the objects in the scene and their relations
	* with attention and background: the attention/focus on the object is still quite strong but we see a combination of both (which is good)
	* the other thing: attention is acting as visual attention
  - Gecko workshop with nice recorded talks https://sites.google.com/view/gecko2020/home (also relevant for this paper)
  - Next
	* Evaluations of generations by others (rank the generations from the best to worst), select images that are easy (one visually focuse dobject and some background objects) and hard (no visually focused object)
	* Skeleton of the headings/argument points for the paper; define the focus of the paper; identify missing arguments

  - Evaluation
	* Baseline: visual no attention
	* + background information: improvement
	* What search is used in Krause? This is not clear? Another paper claims that Krause is using beam search.
  - CIDER: TF/IDF on bigrams
  - METEOR: takes into account synonyms and paraphrases
  - CIDER has the highest improvement in our cases: because of TF/IDF CIDER is biased to more specific descriptions which we observed is the case with our descriptions anyway
  - Beam search produces very short sentences: problem with the beamsearch implementtation: uses sum rather than product
  - Nucleus sampling is producing the best results: only choose only from words that jointly represent some probability mass; the threshold is deifned as a parameter; 0.9 works the best; this will affect the number of words we can choose from each time; and then we randomly choose one of those words;
  - Attention is placed on the discourse LSTM; it helps the system tolearn how to realise background knowledge in the paragraph accross different sentences; because we know thta humans focus on different information when they start and proceed with describing; diversity in the sense that there some topic progression from one sentence to another; we hope that the discourse LSTM will learn how to attend to different chunks of background knowledge and visual information related to those; this gives us a discourse model; this is shown by attention maps

Paper 1:

  - Background knowledge is useful for generating interesting descriptions as it provides additional richness of descriptions
	* The background knowledge provides additional information what is worth mentioning in the image; how humans conceputalise the world and devide scenes into objects and relations between objects
	* The model is able to use synonyms of words that it encounters
	* Descriptions do not only refer to what is seen
	* The descriptions provide background information, priming; they are explciit descriptions of individual objects with focus on what is relevant; we have additional information about objects;
	* In addition to information in the generated output text we are also priming the system with information how to describe objects; very similar to Mooney idea of providing explanations
	* The paragraph does provide conceptual information about objects but only those that are referred to in a description; in a single text maybe not all properties of the scene are mentioned but only those that were considered relavant by a describer; a describer could describe other important information which can be extracted from the background information; attention may be subjective
	* The model is able to hallucinate up to a point but halucination must be grounded in image; there is good question where the boundary generating grounded and ungrounded descriptions is
	* We are not necessarily hallucinating since we are basing it on actual descriptions of several objects; we are providing a more complete description of the image and the relations we find there to help to generate the descriptions; the original model is also hallucinating
	* Densecaps are relevant descriptions of objects

  - We have visual and linguistic topic represnetation of each image; then this informaiton is combined to get multi-modal topics; these are then attended to drive to drive the discourse LSTM which is repsonsible for generating discourse units/sentences; the Liang paper uses phrases to generate the words in sentences; they see it as fragments which should be glued together in a sentence; whereas we see it as providing a topic what can be said about the image and then the system is free to generate individual sentences from that
  - Topic modelling: we create visual and textual topics; from these topics the system learnes how to realise these topics in idnvidual paragraph
  - Evaluation:
	* The produces more interesting descriptions given the baseline
	* We need to say something that we really are learning topics; look at the attention maps for the combinaed features; attention there is over visual-language topics and the previous state of the discourse LSTM; it's modelling to what degree we take into account new topics and to what degree we are following from the previous discourse unit
  - Parallel co-attention: visual features are passed tohtough a dense layer and then multiplied with the linguistic features; hence visual features are adapted to linguistci features which cretae our topics (affinity matrix)
  - What to describe when?
	* Adding more to what
	* Adding the ability select when
  - Models
	* Baseline 1: Krause without end of sentence prediction
	* Model 2: Add linguistic topics (VL Topics with co-attention) and discourse attention
	* Model 3: Add only linguistic topics
  - To do:
      * Implement models with VL topics and attention (all combinations)
	  * Visualisation of attention with and without topics
	  * Evaluation (both beam search and samplign); qualitative evaluation to examine whether sampling is better
	  * Measuring diversity in the generated paragraphs (using frequencies of types and other measures, N's slides)

  - Multi-modal fusion possibilities:

	* combinate visual and background into a single 512 vector with multiplication and test; does this improve end of sentence detection and also generates interesting descriptions
	* no pooling, hence 50 x 1024 or 50 x 512; then a dense layer to 512

## 2020-05-01

  - How to add attention (similar to Lu and Ghanimifard):
  * In addition to visual embedding we also have ambedding from the phrases generated by DenseCap
  * attend on a vector that contains visual embeddings and phrases from the DenseCap
  * Motivation: DenseCap descriptions will be descriptions of the most visible objects in the scene; in DenseCap we can control the number of region proposals from which unique objects are identified (there are constraints on how objects are combined); the number of identified objects is not the same for images; (1) we could take the visual features of these identified objects as a vector of attended objects for example; (2) we take the actual LSTM hidden state of the generated descriptions of these proposals; in both cases we are testing the effects of transfer learning
  * MaxPooling is now performing the task of attention; MaxPooling also from DenseCap regions and DenseCap description vectors; maybe in later versions replace with attention
  * Where to introduce attention; before Sentence LSTM to generate sentence topics or at the level of Word LSTM to generate individual words?
  *
  * S. Ullman. Visual routines. Cognition, 18(1â€“3):97â€“159, 1984.
  - Where to introduce attention?
	* Attention over visual features and the DenseCap features: what is relevant in the image to describe?
	* Attention on sentence LSTM: how to describe rleevant information accross sentences
	* Attention over words: how to generate individual words in a sentence
  - Next:
	* Extract linguistic information from DenseCap and add it to the model with MaxPooling; (1) visual representations of the identified regions (2) LSTM language model of the identified regions; (3) both

   * Nucleus model with temperature is the best (comparing the generations manually)

On the intent in image description tasks

  - The task of image captioning/descriptions is unnatural; there is no clearly expressed intent which is defined by the task
  - The images are taken with a particular intent but this is not visible to captioners (e.g. the beach and the climbing boy example)
  - This leads to problems:
	* The quality of the descriptions: people are unsure what they should be describing; they resort to very generic descriptions: highly technical, e.g. man woman, etc. quite uninteresting; the problem of evaluation?
	* The quality of the images: they are not representing very typical scenes sometimes and therefore relations are less visual; even describers halucinate/rely on their world knowledge
	* Sometimes the descriptions that are generated are valid but different from the ground truth; we do not know whether the system is looking at what it is describing or halucinating; there may be several different tasks/intention for a particula picture; the system may have identified that from the LM but it is not grounded
	- But even if we know the intent; then the system needs to learn a discousre model of a particular task/intent; what are valid sequences of sentences in a paragrpH, how dow e approach to describe a particular task; generate a general description and then focus on individual details; paragraph discourse model
	_ The role of attention: the model needs to learn what features to attend on;: the attention is at different levels; the image, general topics; how to structure the paragraphs; how to generate individual words in a sentence
	- Keywords:
	  * visual data
	  * task orintedness
	  * attention


## 2020-04-23

  - Baseline model with no pre-training now generates very good descriptions; the problem was in the way the generation was implementaed; it was conditioned on the ground truth rather than previous prediction
  - Different implementations of search
	* Greedy search: generic output, frequenetly incorrect and repetitive
	* Sampling from multinomial distribution https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.multinomial.html for implementation see Softmax-with-temperature-test.ods

  - Using Densecap embeddings and LSTM language model and fine-tuning them (initilaise only and then update the weights) improves the performance
  - A system without the denscap language model generates fragmented phrases (which seem to be good) but the syntax is fragmented

  - Passing the LSTM cell state of the last word of the previous sentence as an input to the sentence LSTM makes a difference in predicting whether this is the last sentence
  - The semantics of the previous sentence (word-embeddings)
  - the effects of the batch size on training
  - The curiousc case of loss:
    * validation loss is initially low, after a few epochs is equal and then subseqwuently slighty higher but still following training loss and decreasing; we cut off training when the validation loss increases
    * large batch sizes require more training, but the overall loss is lower and overfitting happens later; large batch sizes are conservative in updates but they nonetheless achieve overall lower loss
    * experiment: start training with 128 BS and then later increase the batch size; and then increase the BS to 256; large BS as fine tuning? S's expectation is that this will only speed up the training; N's expectation is that we would actually reach lower validation; compare where BS is constant, e.g. 256 with a case where BS is first 128 and then switched to 256; a case of fine tuning
    * experiment: represent dense-cap captions as a document topic vector; NAACL in New Orleans a keynote on poetry egenration; a best paper on story generation; both papers some represnettaion; having denscap texts summarised as a vector would tell us what is interesting in the picture; attention on what is interesting to describe in this picture for humans;
    * pass the densacap through some sentence embeddings encoder; pre-trained embeddings for dense-caps, encode densecaps to a semantics vector which represents the attention through language in the model
